## About us

**onesrv – IT without compromises**
We’re an IT service provider based in Germany; we run our *own* hardware, in *our* own racks, on *our* terms. From proactive managed IT for businesses to green bare‑metal servers, we believe real quality means owning every layer of the stack.

**HypeSrv – hosting reinvented**
We’re gamers and developers fed up with hosts that over‑allocate resources on outdated hardware and saddle everyone with the same clunky panels. So we’re rolling our own platform: custom software paired with top‑tier Ryzen nodes—to deliver blazing performance and a UI you’ll actually enjoy using. The mission: absolute user satisfaction backed by stunning, exceptional customer support.

## Open source & community

We share the building blocks whenever we can, but for some of our projects that is sadly not possible:
